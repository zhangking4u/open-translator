# OpenTranslator Project Status


## 1. Project Overview

Project Name:

OpenTranslator


Vision:

Build an open-source, local AI translation infrastructure.

The goal is to provide universal translation capability across desktop applications, browsers, meetings and mobile devices.

The system should be:

- Local-first
- Privacy-preserving
- Free and open-source
- Extensible


---

## 2. Product Direction

MVP Goal:

Desktop selection translation.


Primary user scenario:

A user selects English text anywhere on the desktop and immediately receives AI-powered translation.


Example:

Input:

kernel panic


Output:

内核崩溃

Explanation:

Linux terminology describing a fatal kernel error state.

## 6. Completed Work


### Environment

Completed:

- Ubuntu development environment
- Git installation
- Rust toolchain installation


### Core Service

Completed:

- Rust project created
- Axum HTTP server
- Health endpoint
- Translation endpoint(mock)


Current APIs:


GET:

/health


POST:

/translate


Example:

Input:

hello world


Current output:

[Mock Translation] hello world


---

## 7. Git Status


Current branch:

main


Latest commit:

docs: log timeout guard and runtime check


---

## 8. Current Development Phase


Sprint:

Sprint 2 (preparation)


Goal:

Integrate a local translation model.


---

## 9. Next Steps


1. Install and benchmark a model runtime (Ollama / llama.cpp server)

2. Integrate first local translation model adapter

3. Extend config with model address and model name

4. Prepare desktop client integration


---

## 10. Development Principles


Follow:

- Clean Architecture
- Domain Driven Design concepts
- API-first design
- Modular architecture
- Open-source engineering practices


Avoid:

- Premature complexity
- Tight coupling with a specific model
- Platform-specific implementation in core layer


---

## Sprint 1.2 Progress


Completed:

- Created translation domain model
- Added TranslationEngine trait (async, dyn-compatible)
- Added MockTranslationEngine
- Integrated API with engine layer
- Split API layer into `src/api`
- Added library target (`src/lib.rs`) with unit and integration tests


Current runtime flow:


HTTP API

↓

Translation Domain

↓

TranslationEngine

↓

MockEngine

↓

TranslationResult


Status:

Translation architecture abstraction completed; API layer split and test foundation in place.


## Sprint 2 Preparation Progress


Completed:

- TranslationEngine now returns `Result` with a shared `TranslationError`
- API maps errors to JSON `{"error":{"kind","message"}}` (400/500/502/504)
- Env-based config: `TRANSLATOR_BIND_ADDR`, `TRANSLATOR_ENGINE`, `TRANSLATOR_TIMEOUT_MS`; engine factory (`engine::build`)
- Timeout guard (`TimeoutEngine`) wrapping every engine; expiry maps to 504
- Language tag normalization (`domain::language`) and MT prompt builder (`domain::prompt`)
- Tests for invalid input, engine failure, timeout, config parsing and prompt building


Pending:

- Model runtime installation and selection (none installed on the dev machine)
- Model adapter and model config (address, model name)
